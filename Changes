    [ENHANCEMENTS]

    Sometimes creating HTML::Lint-compliant HTML just isn't possible.
    Now, you can now turn individual errors on and off in your HTML
    via comment directives, like so:

        <!-- html-lint elem-img-sizes-missing: off, attr-unknown: off -->

    And if you have a batch of code that's hopeless:

        <!-- html-lint all: off -->

    Added check for unknown entities, such as "&foo;".

    Added check for unclosed entitities, such as "&amp" without the
    closing semicolon.

    Added a check for a bare ampersand that should be written as &amp;

    [FIXES]
    Tags that were self-closed were being ignored.  For example, if you had

        <img src="blah.jpg" />

    then HTML::Lint would ignore the tag.  This has been fixed.

    [LICENSE]
    HTML::Lint is now explicitly licensed under Artistic License 2.0,
    instead of the vague "same terms as Perl itself."


2.06    Thu Dec 18 00:07:54 CST 2008
    [FIXES]
    Added attributes to <frameset>.

    <strong> tag didn't allow any attributes.  Now it does.

    Removed the <listing> tag.


2.04    Mon Jun  2 11:41:16 CDT 2008
    [FIXES]
    <textarea> now knows about the wrap attribute.

    [INTERNALS]
    Lots of enhancements pointed out by Perl::Critic.


2.02    Thu Nov  3 11:49:18 CST 2005
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * The warnings for missing ALT and HEIGHT/WIDTH on your images
        now give the SRC attribute.


2.00    Tue Sep 20 23:10:39 CDT 2005
    [CHANGES THAT COULD BREAK YOUR CODE]
    * I've changed the object structure.  HTML::Lint now has-a
        HTML::Parser, and no longer is-a HTML::Parser.

    * weblint-cgi and weblint-original are no longer distributed
        with HTML::Lint.

    * Now requires Perl 5.6.0.

    [FIXES]
    * Line numbering is now correct if you parse more than one file.

    * Changed t/*.*.t so that they only had one period in the
        filename. Apparently VMS doesn't like filenames with multiple
        dots.


Pre-2.00
    I've thrown away previous history because really, nobody cares
    what changed in this module prior to 2005.
