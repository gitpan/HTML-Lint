HTML::Lint is a pure-Perl HTML parser and checker for syntactic legitmacy.

The "weblint" script is now pretty much a wrapper around the HTML::Lint
module. 

You can also look into Apache::Lint which is a mod_perl wrapper around
HTML::Lint.

Finally, for those of you doing automated testing with Test::More and
its brethren, Test::HTML::Lint lets you automate HTML checking.

Please let me know if any tests fail.
