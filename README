HTML::Lint is a pure-Perl HTML parser and checker for syntactic legitmacy.

The "weblint" script is now pretty much a wrapper around the HTML::Lint module.
The following things aren't implemented in the weblint script at the moment:

	* checking of links (will be left for a separate program)
	* check URLs (using LWP)
	* Netscape & Microsoft extensions (do they have any these days?)

You can also look into Apache::Lint which is a mod_perl wrapper around HTML::Lint.

To install this you should just have to do:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Please let me know if any tests fail.

I'm using Perl 5.6.1.
