HTML::Lint Version 0.90

HTML::Lint is broken down into a number of perl modules:

	HTML::Lint		- provides the "weblint engine"
	HTML::Lint::HTML4	- encapsulation of messages
	HTML::Lint::Messages	- encapsulation of messages
	HTML::Lint::Constants	- constants used in the different modules

The "weblint" script is now pretty much a wrapper around the HTML::Lint module.
The following things aren't implemented in the weblint script at the moment:

	* checking of links (will be left for a separate program)
	* check URLs (using LWP)
	* Netscape & Microsoft extensions (do they have any these days?)

The distribution also includes weblint-cgi:

	* first cut at a web-based interface to weblint
	* requires LWP
	* doesn't have the overhead of external processes
	* this is a very early version

To install this you should just have to do:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The weblint-cgi script won't be installed.

Please let me know if any tests fail.

I'm using Perl 5.6.1.
